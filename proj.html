        Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is home to world class rock climbing,
        skiing, and hiking. Located only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City,
        UT, locals enjoy year-round access to rock climbing, and more
        specifically, bouldering. LCC is also a popular destination for climbers
        from all around the world due to its unique granite climbing. Presently,
        the Utah Department of Transportation is debating a final transportation
        recommendation to address traffic in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In the
        summer of 2022, they identified a gondola from the base of the canyon to
        Snowbird and Alta, two private ski resorts, as the preferred
        alternative. This gondola would have extreme and irrevocable impacts on
        Little Cottonwood Canyon, destroying boulders that climbers have
        cherished for years. Goodbye Gondola is a visualization displaying the
        potential boulders that will be affected by the gondola construction,
        providing a sense of the large-scale impact that the gondola would have
        on bouldering in LCC.

            The map feature of the visualization includes three varying data
            point to represent the climbing areas, affected boulders, and
            gondola towers. To interact with the map, simply hover over the
            various data points for more information, zoom in and out to narrow
            the view, or click on an area to zoom to that area. When you zoom
            in, or click on an area, the table and info chart data will change
            dynamically to the area selected or the data within the zoomed view.

              Areas
            </h4>
            Climbing areas are groups of boulders, where each boulder can be
            described as being in an area. For example, the split boulder is in
            Five Mile, which is an area. These are represented by blue
            rectangles on the map. By hovering over an area, you can see the
            location and name, as well as total views of the page, meaning the
            popularity of the area. By clicking on the area, the map will zoom
            to that area and center on it.

              Boulders
            </h4>
            Boulders are large chunks of rock, in the case of LCC they are more
            specifically granite chunks. Each boulder has various boulder
            problems on them, which is a unique path up the boulder. Each
            problem is graded on a V-Scale. The V-Scale ranges from V0, being
            the easiest, to V16, being the hardest offered in LCC. The V-Scale
            is universal to all bouldering across the world. The boulders that
            will be destroyed due to the gondola construction are represented on
            the map as grey circles.
            <h4
              style="

              Gondola Towers
            </h4>
            The gondola towers are large metal poles, around 10 feet in
            diameter, that will be the support beams for the gondola line. There
            are a total of 22 towers, proposed to be constructed starting at the
            base of LCC to the two ski resorts at the top. These towers are
            represented by a red rectangle nested inside of a cirle, meant to
            show the area of impact around the tower.

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Goodbye Gondola Table/Chart</h3>
            The chart and table feature of the visualization show the current
            selection data, displaying the total boulder problems and affected
            boulder problems in the stacked bar chart, as well as information on
            each boulder problem in the table. Here, it is easy to see the total
            impact of the gondola construction, as well as the impact to certain
            areas by utlizing the drop down menu to select and area, or by
            clicking an area in the map view.
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: darkred">Bar Chart</h4>
            The bar chart displays the total boulders of each V grade in the
            area. The X-Axis is the V grade of the boulder and the Y-Axis is the
            count of each boulder. In the chart, it can be seen how many of the
            boulders in the current selection are affected based on the stacked
            bar chart and tooltip. The red portion of the bar represents the
            affected boulders and the grey is the unaffected boulder for each V
            grade in the selected area.
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(165, 120, 229)">Table</h4>
            The table displays the same selection data as the bar chart, showing
            the information on the current selection. The table has multiple
            columns that can be sorted on, showing the highest grade, views per
            page, ratings etc. for each selection. To interact with the table,
            you can simply scroll to see which boulders are affected, indicated
            by red highlight, or sort each column by clicking on the header of
            that column. When the selection changes, the table changes
            dynamically to show the current data.
            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(62, 61, 61)">
              Map Display Switch
            </h4>
            The map display switch is used to switch between selections of the
            current area selected in the drop down, and the data displayed in
            the current map view. When an area is selected from the drop down,
            the map is centered on that area, and the table and chart data
            changes to match that area. However, if the you want to be able to
            display all of the data in the current view window, not just the
            selected area, it is not possible without the switch. The switch
            allows you to select and area, and then switch from an area
            selection to the data in the map view, which could be multiple
            areas, not just the current selected one. When the switch is on, the
            current map view data is selected, and when it is off, the area in
            the drop down, or selected on the map is the selection.
