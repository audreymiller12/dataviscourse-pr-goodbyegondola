                Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is home to world class rock climbing, skiing, and hiking. Located only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City, UT, 
                locals enjoy year-round access to rock climbing, and more specifically, bouldering. LCC is also a popular destination for climbers from all around 
                the world due to its unique granite climbing. Presently, the Utah Department of Transportation is debating a final transportation recommendation 
                to address traffic in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In the summer of 2022, they identified a gondola from the base of the canyon to Snowbird and Alta, 
                two private ski resorts, as the preferred alternative. This gondola would have extreme and irrevocable impacts on Little Cottonwood Canyon, 
                destroying boulders that climbers have cherished for years. Goodbye Gondola is a visualization displaying the potential boulders that will be 
                affected by the gondola construction, providing a sense of the large-scale impact that the gondola would have on bouldering in LCC.

             <h3>Goodbye Gondola Map:</h3> The map feature of the visualization includes three varying data point to represent the climbing areas, affected boulders, and gondola towers.
             <h4>Areas: </h4>Climbing areas are groups of boulders, where each boulder can be described as being in an area. For example, the split boulder is in Five Mile, 
             which is an area. These are represented by blue rectangles on the map.
             <h4>Boulders: </h4> Boulders are chunks of rock, generally less than 20 feet tall. In LCC, boulders are made of granite. 
             Each boulder has various boulder problems on them, which is a unique path up the boulder. 
             Each problem is graded on a V-Scale. The V-Scale ranges from V0, the easiest, to V16, the hardest offered in LCC. 
             The V-Scale is universal to all bouldering across the world. The boulders that will be destroyed due to the gondola construction are represented on the map as grey circles.
            <h4>Gondola Towers: </h4> The gondola towers are large metal poles, around 10 feet in diameter, that will be the support beams for the
            gondola line. There are a total of 22 towers, proposed to be constructed starting at the base of LCC to the two ski resorts at the top. 
            These towers are represented by a red rectangle nested inside of a cirle, meant to show the area of impact around the tower.
