## Project Background

Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is home to world class rock climbing, skiing, and hiking. Located only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City, UT, locals enjoy year-round access to rock climbing, and more specifically, bouldering. LCC is also a popular destination for climbers from all around the world due to its unique granite climbing. Presently, the Utah Department of Transportation is debating a final transportation recommendation to address traffic in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In the summer of 2022, they published their [Final Environmental Impact Statement](https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/), which identified a gondola from the base of the canyon to Snowbird and Alta, two private ski resorts, as the preferred alternative. This gondola would have extreme and irrevocable impacts on Little Cottonwood Canyon, destroying boulders that climbers have cherished for years. Goodbye Gondola is a visualization displaying the potential boulders that will be affected by the gondola construction, providing a sense of the large-scale impact that the gondola would have on bouldering in LCC.

## Visualization Features

### Goodbye Gondola Map
The map feature of the visualization includes three varying data point to represent the climbing areas, affected boulders, and gondola towers. To interact with the map, simply hover over the various data points for more information, zoom in and out to narrow the view, or click on an area to zoom to that area. When you zoom in or click on an area, the table and info chart data will change dynamically to the area selected or the data within the zoomed view.

### Goodbye Gondola Table/Chart
The chart and table feature of the visualization show the current selection data, displaying the total boulder problems and affected boulder problems in the stacked bar chart, as well as information on each boulder problem in the table. Here, it is easy to see the total impact of the gondola construction as well as the impact to certain areas. You can select an area using the dropdown meu or by clicking on an area in the map view.

## Data Sources
Data on climbing areas and boulders was scraped from the [Mountain Project's Little Cottonwood Canyon](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105739277/little-cottonwood-canyon) pages. Data on gondola tower locations is published by the Utah Department of Transportation in their [LCC EIS Alternative Interactive Maps](https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/) as part of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
