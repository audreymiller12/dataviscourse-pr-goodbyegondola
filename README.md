## Project Background

Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is home to world class rock climbing, skiing, and hiking. Located only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City, UT, locals enjoy year-round access to rock climbing, and more specifically, bouldering. LCC is also a popular destination for climbers from all around the world due to its unique granite climbing. Presently, the Utah Department of Transportation is debating a final transportation recommendation to address traffic in Little Cottonwood Canyon. In the summer of 2022, they published their [Final Environmental Impact Statement](https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/), which identified a gondola from the base of the canyon to Snowbird and Alta, two private ski resorts, as the preferred alternative. This gondola would have extreme and irrevocable impacts on Little Cottonwood Canyon, destroying boulders that climbers have cherished for years. Goodbye Gondola is a visualization displaying the potential boulders that will be affected by the gondola construction, providing a sense of the large-scale impact that the gondola would have on bouldering in LCC.


## How to Interact with the Visualization

            *Goodbye Gondola Map*
            The map feature of the visualization includes three varying data
            points to represent the climbing areas, affected boulders, and
            gondola towers. To interact with the map, simply hover over the
            various data points for more information, zoom in and out to narrow
            the view, or click on an area to zoom to that area. When you zoom
            in or click on an area, the table and info chart data will change
            dynamically to the area selected or the data within the zoomed view.

            Map features:
            
            *Areas*
            
            Climbing areas are groups of boulders. Groups of boulders are contained within 
            areas. For example, the Split Boulder is in the Five Mile area. Areas are 
            represented by blue rectangles on the map. By hovering over an area, 
            you can see the location and name, as well as total views of the Mountain Project 
            page, which represents the popularity of the area. By clicking on the area, 
            the map will zoom to the area and center on it.
