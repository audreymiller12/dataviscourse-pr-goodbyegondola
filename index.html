        Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is home to world class rock climbing,
        skiing, and hiking. Located only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City,
        UT, locals enjoy year-round access to rock climbing, and more
        specifically, bouldering. LCC is also a popular destination for climbers
        from all around the world due to its unique granite climbing. Presently,
        the Utah Department of Transportation is debating a final transportation
        recommendation to address traffic in Little Cottonwood Canyon. 
        In the summer of 2022, they published their <a href="https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/" target="_blank">Final Environmental Impact Statement</a>, 
        which identified a gondola from the base of the canyon to Snowbird and Alta, 
        two private ski resorts, as the preferred alternative. 
        This gondola would have extreme and irrevocable impacts on
        Little Cottonwood Canyon, destroying boulders that climbers have
        cherished for years. Goodbye Gondola is a visualization displaying the
        potential boulders that will be affected by the gondola construction,
        providing a sense of the large-scale impact that the gondola would have
        on bouldering in LCC.

            The map feature of the visualization includes three varying data
            point to represent the climbing areas, affected boulders, and
            gondola towers. To interact with the map, simply hover over the
            various data points for more information, zoom in and out to narrow
            the view, or click on an area to zoom to that area. When you zoom
            in or click on an area, the table and info chart data will change
            dynamically to the area selected or the data within the zoomed view.

              Areas
            </h4>
            Data on climbing areas and boulders was scraped from 
            <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105739277/little-cottonwood-canyon" target="_blank">Mountain Project</a>, 
            an online database of climbing routes and boulders. 
            Mountain Project contains geographic data on climbing areas and boulders 
            as well as description of climbs, ratings, page views, which indicate popularity, 
            and comments. 
            
            Climbing areas contain groups of boulders. For example, the Split Boulder 
            is in the Five Mile area. Areas are represented by blue rectangles on the map. 
            By hovering over an area, 
            you can see the location and name, as well as total views of the Mountain Project 
            page, which represents the popularity of the area. By clicking on the area, 
            the map will zoom to the area and center on it.

              Boulders
            </h4>
            Boulders are large rocks, generally less than 20 feet tall. 
            In LCC, boulders are made of granite. Each boulder has various boulder 
            problems on them, which is a unique path up the boulder. Each problem is 
            graded on a V-Scale. The V-Scale ranges from V0, the easiest, to V16, 
            the hardest offered in LCC. The V-Scale is universal to all bouldering 
            across the world. The boulders that will be destroyed due to the gondola 
            construction are represented on the map as grey circles.
            <h4
              style="
                text-align: center;

              Gondola Towers
            </h4>
            Gondola tower locations are published on UDOT's <a href="https://littlecottonwoodeis.udot.utah.gov/final-eis/" target="_blank">Final EIS</a> Interactive Maps.
            The gondola towers are large metal poles around 10 feet in diameter that 
            will be the support beams for the gondola line. There are a total of 22 
            towers proposed to be constructed. The towers will start at the base of 
            LCC and extend all the way through the canyon to the two ski resorts at the top. 
            These towers are represented by a red rectangle nested inside of a circle, 
            meant to show the area of impact around the tower.

            <h3 style="text-align: center">Goodbye Gondola Table/Chart</h3>

            The chart and table feature of the visualization show the current 
            selection data, displaying the total boulder problems and affected 
            boulder problems in the stacked bar chart, as well as information on 
            each boulder problem in the table. Here, it is easy to see the total 
            impact of the gondola construction as well as the impact to certain areas. 
            You can select an area using the dropdown meu or by clicking on an area 
            in the map view.

            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: darkred">Bar Chart</h4>

            The bar chart displays the total boulder problems of each V-grade in the area. 
            The X-Axis shows the V-grade of the boulder problem, and the Y-Axis shows the 
            counts of boulder problems. They grey bar shows the total number of boulder 
            problems in the selected area. The red portion of the stacked bar chart shows 
            the number of affected boulder problems in the selected area.

            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(165, 120, 229)">Table</h4>

            The table displays the same data as the bar chart, showing 
            information on the current selection. The table can be sorted by each column, 
            both ascending and descending. To interact with the table, you can simply 
            scroll to see which boulders are affected, indicated by red highlight, 
            or sort each column by clicking on the header of that column. 
            When the selection changes, the table changes dynamically to show the 
            current data.

            <h4 style="text-align: center; color: rgb(62, 61, 61)">
              Map Display Switch
            </h4>

            The map display toggle switch is used to switch between the data displayed 
            in the current map view and area selections from the drop-down menu. When an area 
            is selected from the drop-down, the map zooms to center on that area and the 
            table and chart data change to display data for that area. Moving the map or 
            zooming in or out will change the toggle switch back to map view. To display 
            all of the data in the current view window, not just the selected area, 
            change the toggle switch back to map view. When the toggle switch is on, 
            the current map view data is displayed, and when it is off, the selected area 
            from the drop-down menu or the clicked area map is displayed.
